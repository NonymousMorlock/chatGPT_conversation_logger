**ME:** assuming I have an html file and I want a simple input field with a button below it that has the text Guess and on click of the guess, I want to take the value of the input field and go to the url "my_url/user/value_of_input" How would I write this in my html file
**ChatGPT:** 
```dart
Markdown(
  data: '## Hello, World!\nThis is some **Markdown** content.',
  styleSheet: MarkdownStyleSheet(
    h2: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
    strong: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
  ),
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),
  physics: BouncingScrollPhysics(),
);
```
