# Software and Hardware
**Sofware interfaces with hardware**

## APP
__________________________

## OS - Intermediary 
{
Manages hardware
Without OS the computer is just a shell
for every application installed, the OS has to register it in the system registry
}
    |  Application Software -: Usually 3rd Party
       --------------------
       System Software
__________________________

## Software
is split into system and application software


Softwares are in libraries and are put into APIs 
APIs allows manufacturers and users to connect to system resources. SYSTEM RESOURCES - Hard DISK=>(HDD-SDD)


# EXCEL

MS OFFICE is a suite 
- EXCEL - Numerical Computation
- WORD - Word/Text Processing
- POWERPOINT - Presentation software
- ACCESS - Database Application
- ONE NOTE - 

Microsoft - First software => MS DOS

### What we can do with Excel

**Broad Applications of Excel**

1. We can store information temporarily -: Its not a database application
2. We can perform arithmetic calculations in excel
3. We can present information in a graphical format:
    - charts
        - Line Graphs
        - Bar Graphs
4. We can forecast data 
    - *What-If Analysis*
        Takes various variables, and can predict the change over time based on the values of these variables
        e.g If a company has made 5 million for a year, we could say, what-if the price goes this way, then what will happen to the value of said company, we can predict this using excel

5. We can sort and search information

### How does the Computer System Process Information

**Machine Language** is the language the computer understands, This Encompasses Assembly(probably including Binary) - This was the first Language, before Assembly

**Assembly Language** still had Os and 1s but had some simple commands (a.k.a Assembly language instruction)

After Sometime they combined the Assembly and Machine as **Low-Level Language.**

0s and 1s are bits?

*BIT* - BInary digiT
8 bits => 1 byte
1024 bytes => 1kb
1024 kb => 1mb => GB => TB => PB
