**ME:** I'm building a flutter app and with Django as the backend, we have an option to change password when user forgets password, but on the django backend, we first take the user email, then send them a password reset link, then they click it and go to the reset password place, which will allow user to enter new password, how will I implement this on my flutter front end

**ChatGPT:** To implement password reset functionality in your Flutter app with Django as the backend, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a UI for the "forgot password" screen in your Flutter app where the user can enter their email address.

2. When the user submits their email address, send a request to your Django backend with the user's email address.

3. In your Django backend, generate a unique token and send it to the user's email address along with a link to the password reset screen.

4. In your Flutter app, create a UI for the password reset screen where the user can enter a new password.

5. When the user clicks on the link in their email, it should open the password reset screen in your Flutter app. The unique token should be passed as a parameter to the password reset screen.

6. In your Flutter app, when the user submits the new password, send a request to your Django backend along with the unique token and the new password.

7. In your Django backend, verify that the unique token is valid and reset the user's password.

8. Return a response to your Flutter app indicating whether the password reset was successful or not, and display an appropriate message to the user.

Overall, this process involves creating two UI screens in your Flutter app (forgot password and password reset), and implementing the necessary API endpoints in your Django backend to handle the password reset flow.
**ME:** give me details with code examples on how to do step 5(deep linking) and getting parameters off the deep link
**ChatGPT:** To implement deep linking in your Flutter app, you can use the `uni_links` package, which provides a simple API for handling incoming deep links. Here is an example of how to use `uni_links` to handle a password reset link with a unique token parameter:

1. First, add the `uni_links` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get`:


```yaml
dependencies:
  uni_links: ^0.5.2
```

2. Next, initialize the `uni_links` package in your `main()` method:


```dart
import 'package:uni_links/uni_links.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart' show PlatformException;

Future<void> main() async {
  // Initialize the uni_links package
  try {
    await initUniLinks();
  } on PlatformException {
    // Handle errors
  }
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

3. In your password reset screen, use the `getInitialLink()` method to check if the app was opened from a deep link. If it was, parse the unique token parameter from the deep link and store it for later use:


```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:uni_links/uni_links.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart' show PlatformException;

class PasswordResetScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _PasswordResetScreenState createState() => _PasswordResetScreenState();
}

class _PasswordResetScreenState extends State<PasswordResetScreen> {
  String _uniqueToken;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    // Check if the app was opened from a deep link
    getInitialLink().then((uri) {
      if (uri != null) {
        // Parse the unique token parameter from the deep link
        setState(() {
          _uniqueToken = uri.queryParameters['token'];
        });
      }
    });

    // Listen for future deep links
    getUriLinksStream().listen((uri) {
      if (uri != null) {
        // Parse the unique token parameter from the deep link
        setState(() {
          _uniqueToken = uri.queryParameters['token'];
        });
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Password Reset'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            if (_uniqueToken == null)
              Text('No password reset link detected'),
            if (_uniqueToken != null)
              Text('Unique token: $_uniqueToken'),
            // Add UI for resetting the password
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, we use the `getInitialLink()` method to check if the app was opened from a deep link when the password reset screen is first loaded. We also listen for future deep links using the `getUriLinksStream()` method.

When a deep link is received, we parse the `token` query parameter from the deep link URL using the `queryParameters` property of the `Uri` object. We then store the unique token in the `_uniqueToken` state variable and update the UI to display the token.

4. On the Django backend, make sure that the password reset link includes the unique token as a query parameter, like this:


```
https://example.com/reset-password/?token=<unique-token>
```

When the user clicks on the password reset link in their email, it should open your Flutter app and pass the unique token as a parameter to the password reset screen.

That's it! With this code, you should be able to handle incoming password reset links with unique token parameters in your Flutter
