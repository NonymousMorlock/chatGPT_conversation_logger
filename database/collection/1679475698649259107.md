**ME:** give me step by step guide on how to fetch my balance for specific crypto coins on binance using the binance API using python

**ChatGPT:** Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to fetch your balance for specific crypto coins on Binance using the Binance API using Python:

1. First, you need to create an account on Binance and generate your API key and secret key. You can do this by logging into your Binance account, going to the API Management page, and creating a new API key.

2. Install the `binance` module using pip, which allows you to interact with the Binance API using Python.


```
pip install binance
```

3. Import the necessary modules and define your API keys as environment variables.


```python
import os
from binance.client import Client

api_key = os.environ.get('BINANCE_API_KEY')
api_secret = os.environ.get('BINANCE_API_SECRET')

client = Client(api_key, api_secret)
```

4. Get your account information to verify that your API keys are working.


```python
account_info = client.get_account()
print(account_info)
```

5. To fetch your balance for a specific crypto coin, you can use the `get_asset_balance` method of the `Client` class.


```python
balance = client.get_asset_balance(asset='BTC')
print(balance)
```
This will return a dictionary containing information about your BTC balance, including the available balance, the on order balance, and the total balance.

You can replace `'BTC'` with the asset code of any other crypto coin that you want to check your balance for.

That's it! By following these steps, you can fetch your balance for specific crypto coins on Binance using the Binance API and Python.
**ME:** how about if I wanted to do the same thing in my flutter project using dart
**ChatGPT:** Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to fetch your balance for specific crypto coins on Binance using the Binance API in your Flutter project using Dart:

1. Add the `binance` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.


```yaml
dependencies:
  binance: ^1.0.4
```

2. Import the necessary packages and create a `BinanceApiClient` object.


```dart
import 'package:binance/binance.dart';

final binanceApiClient = BinanceApiClient();
```

3. Define your API keys as `apiKey` and `apiSecret` variables.


```dart
final apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
final apiSecret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET';
```

4. Initialize the `binanceApiClient` object with your API keys.


```dart
binanceApiClient.setApiKey(apiKey);
binanceApiClient.setApiSecret(apiSecret);
```

5. Get your account information to verify that your API keys are working.


```dart
final accountInfo = await binanceApiClient.getAccountInfo();
print(accountInfo);
```

6. To fetch your balance for a specific crypto coin, you can use the `getAssetBalance` method of the `BinanceApiClient` class.


```dart
final balance = await binanceApiClient.getAssetBalance('BTC');
print(balance);
```

This will return a `BinanceAssetBalance` object containing information about your BTC balance, including the available balance, the on order balance, and the total balance.

You can replace `'BTC`' with the asset code of any other crypto coin that you want to check your balance for.

That's it! By following these steps, you can fetch your balance for specific crypto coins on Binance using the Binance API in your Flutter project using Dart.
**ME:** there's no binance package on pub.dev, can't you do it without a 3rd party package?, just http with the binance api
**ChatGPT:** Yes, you can use HTTP requests to interact with the Binance API directly without any third-party packages. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to fetch your balance for specific crypto coins on Binance using the Binance API in your Flutter project using HTTP requests:

Import the `dart:convert` and `http` packages.


```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

2. Define your API keys as `apiKey` and `apiSecret` variables.


```dart
final apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
final apiSecret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET';
```

3. Define a `Map` object containing the parameters that will be sent with the API request.


```dart
final timestamp = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
final params = {
  'timestamp': timestamp.toString(),
  'recvWindow': '5000',
  'apiKey': apiKey,
};
```

4. Define a `String` object containing the signature of the API request.


```dart
final queryString = Uri(queryParameters: params).query;
final signature = Hmac.sha256(utf8.encode(apiSecret))
    .convert(utf8.encode(queryString))
    .toString();
params['signature'] = signature;
```

5. Define a `String` object containing the URL of the API endpoint you want to call.


```dart
final endpoint = 'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/account';
final url = Uri.parse('$endpoint?$queryString&signature=$signature');
```

6. Send an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint using the http.get method.


```dart
final response = await http.get(url);
```

7. Parse the response body using the `json.decode` method.


```dart
final data = json.decode(response.body);
```

To fetch your balance for a specific crypto coin, you can use the balances field of the data object.


```dart
final balances = data['balances'];
final btcBalance = balances.firstWhere((balance) => balance['asset'] == 'BTC');
print(btcBalance);
```

This will return a `Map` object containing information about your `BTC` balance, including the available balance, the on order balance, and the total balance.

You can replace `'BTC'` with the asset code of any other crypto coin that you want to check your balance for.

That's it! By following these steps, you can fetch your balance for specific crypto coins on Binance using the Binance API in your Flutter project using HTTP requests.
