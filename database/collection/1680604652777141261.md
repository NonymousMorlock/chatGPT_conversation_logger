**ME:** I have a fedora 37 64 bit and I need to download discord, but on the official website, it offers a deb and a tar.gz, which should I choose for fedora and how do I install it

**ChatGPT:** For Fedora, you should choose the tar.gz package. Here are the steps to install Discord on Fedora 37 64-bit:
    1. Download the tar.gz package from the official Discord website.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the package.
    3. Extract the package using the following command: `tar -xf filename.tar.gz`, where "filename" is the name of the tar.gz file you downloaded.
    4. Change to the extracted directory: `cd filename`
    5. Run the following command to install Discord: `./Discord`.
Note: You may need to install additional dependencies, such as libc++.so, libc++abi.so and libX11.so before installing Discord. You can use the following command to install these dependencies: `sudo dnf install libc++ libc++abi libX11`.
**ME:** Error: Unable to find a match: libc++ libc++abi
**ChatGPT:** It looks like the packages libc++ and libc++abi are not available in Fedora's package repository. You can try installing the required dependencies using the following command:

```
sudo dnf install libstdc++ libX11
```
After installing the dependencies, try running the `./Discord` command again.
**ME:** what happens if there's a new update
**ChatGPT:** If there's a new update for Discord, you'll need to download the updated version from the official website and follow the installation steps again.
Here's a general outline of the steps to update Discord:
    1. Download the latest version of Discord from the official website.
    2. Stop the currently running Discord process.
    3. Backup your existing Discord configuration and settings.
    4. Remove the existing Discord installation using the following command: `rm -rf filename`, where "filename" is the name of the directory where you installed Discord.
    5. Extract the new version of Discord using the `tar -xf filename.tar.gz` command.
    6. Navigate to the extracted directory: `cd filename`.
    7. Install the new version of Discord: `./Discord`.
    8. Restore your Discord configuration and settings from the backup.
Note: The exact steps to update Discord may vary depending on your specific setup. These steps are just a general outline, and you may need to modify them to fit your specific requirements.
**ME:** and do I have to go to my terminal and run ./Discord everytime I need to open discord?
**ChatGPT:** No, you don't have to run `./Discord` every time you want to open Discord. You can create a shortcut or launcher for Discord, so that you can open it directly from the application menu or desktop.

Here's how you can create a shortcut for Discord in Fedora:
    1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the Discord tar.gz file.
    2. Create a desktop entry for Discord using the following command: `sudo nano /usr/share/applications/discord.desktop`.
    3. Add the following content to the file:


```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Discord
Exec=/path/to/Discord
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Network;InstantMessaging;
```

    4. Replace "/path/to/Discord" with the actual path to the `Discord` executable file.
    5. Save and close the file.
    6. Refresh the desktop by logging out and logging back in, or by running the following command in the terminal: `sudo update-desktop-database`.

After creating the shortcut, you should be able to open Discord directly from the application menu or desktop.
**ME:** so, if my extraction created a discord folder in this path /home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/
what would be the Exec path
**ChatGPT:** The `Exec` path in the `discord.desktop` file should be set to the full path of the` Discord` executable file within the extracted directory. In your case, if the Discord folder was extracted to `/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/`, the `Exec` path would be:


```
Exec=/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/Discord
```
**ME:** is the last Discord in the path referring to the Discord executable file or the Discord folder that contains the file
**ChatGPT:** The last `Discord` in the path refers to the `Discord` executable file, not the Discord folder.

So, the complete `Exec` path in the `discord.desktop` file would be:


```
Exec=/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/Discord
```

This path points to the `Discord` executable file in the `/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/` directory, and it's what will be executed when you run the Discord shortcut.
**ME:** okay this works, but there is no app icon for it in the search
**ChatGPT:** The missing app icon for Discord can be resolved by adding an `Icon` entry to the `discord.desktop` file.
Here's how you can add an app icon to the Discord shortcut:
    1. Create an image file for the Discord icon and save it in a directory accessible by all users, such as `/usr/share/icons/`.
    2. Open the discord.desktop file using the following command: `sudo nano /usr/share/applications/discord.desktop`.
    3. Add the following line to the file, replacing `icon.png` with the actual name and path of the Discord icon file:


```
Icon=/usr/share/icons/icon.png
```

    4. Save and close the file.
    5. Refresh the desktop by logging out and logging back in, or by running the following command in the terminal:` sudo update-desktop-database`.
After adding the app icon, the Discord shortcut should display the icon in the search results or application menu.
**ME:** there is already a discord.png file in the Discord directory would I need to take it to /usr/share/icons or can I just use the path for the one in the /home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/discord.png
**ChatGPT:** You can use the path for the `discord.png` file within the `/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/` directory.
Here's how you can specify the path in the discord.desktop file:
    1. Open the `discord.desktop` file using the following command: `sudo nano /usr/share/applications/discord.desktop`.
    2. Add the following line to the file:


```
Icon=/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/discord.png
```

    3. Save and close the file.
    4. Refresh the desktop by logging out and logging back in, or by running the following command in the terminal: `sudo update-desktop-database`.
After adding the `Icon` entry to the `discord.deskto`p file, the Discord shortcut should display the `discord.png` file as its icon in the search results or application menu.
**ME:** does the line where I add the Icon value matter or can I just add it anywhere
**ChatGPT:** You can add the `Icon` entry anywhere in the `discord.desktop` file, as long as it's not within a comment section (lines starting with `#`).

It's typical to add the `Icon` entry near the top of the file, along with the other key-value pairs like `Name`, `Exec`, etc.

Here's an example of what the `discord.desktop` file could look like after adding the `Icon` entry:


```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Discord
Exec=/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/Discord
Icon=/home/akundadababalei/Downloads/Discord/discord.png
Type=Application
Categories=Network;InstantMessaging;
```
